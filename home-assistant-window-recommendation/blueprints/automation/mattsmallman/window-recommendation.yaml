blueprint:
  name: Window Action Recommendation (Single Window, Comfort Threshold)
  description: >
    Recommends whether to open, close, or do nothing with a window based on indoor and outdoor temperature differences.
    Only suggests opening windows if the outside temperature is above a user-defined comfort threshold.
    Sends a notification when the recommendation changes.
